# Hello World!
## My name is Meghan and I'm a Human Resources Coordinator at Bonfyre!

### **Three things people should know about me:**
1. I've lived in 5 states and 1 country in the past 7 years
2. I go to the movies at least once a day
3. I worked for The Walt Disney Company for 2 and a half years

#### I'm here because I want to learn more about web development and make the change into being a developer.
